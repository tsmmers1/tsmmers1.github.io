  Rare earth elements serve as components in a wide array of technologies, including catalysts, phosphors, and magnetic materials. Bonding for rare earth element coordination complexes is typically through electrostatic forces instead of covalent interactions; this leads to geometric configurations that are more irregular and fluxional compared to transition metal coordination complexes.

  Computational (molecular dynamics simulations; global optimization searches) and experimental (X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy) methods can be used to resolve the molecular structures an ion-ligand complex will form within solution. Characterizing these solution structures is relevant towards developing materials for lanthanide extraction, medical imaging, molecular magnets, quantum sensors, and other applications.
